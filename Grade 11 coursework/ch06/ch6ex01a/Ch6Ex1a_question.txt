A prime number is an integer greater than 1 that is evenly divisible by only 1 and 
itself. For example, 2, 3, 5, and 7 are prime numbers, but 4, 6, 8, and 9 are not. Create 
a PrimeNumber application that prompts the user for a number and then displays a 
message indicating whether the number is prime or not.
