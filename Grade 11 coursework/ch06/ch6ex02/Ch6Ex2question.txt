The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic states that every positive integer is the product of a set of 
prime numbers. This set is called the prime factors. For example, the prime factors for 140 are 2, 2, 5, 
and 7 (2*2*5*7 = 140). Create a PrimeFactors application that prompts the user for a positive integer 
and then displays that integer’s prime factors. Use the following pseudocode when implementing the 
PrimeFactors code:

Initialize a counter to 2
	while the counter is less than or equal to the number
		if the counter divides the number evenly
			display the counter
			divide the number by the counter to get a new number
		else increment counter by 1
