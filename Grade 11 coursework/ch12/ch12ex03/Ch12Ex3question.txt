 Test results for a multiple choice test can be stored in a text file as follows:
 Line 1: The correct answers, one character per answer
 Line 2: Name of the first student (length <= 30 chars)
 Line 3: Answers for the student in line 2
 The remaining lines: student names and answers on separate lines
 For example:

	BADED
	Smithgall
	BADDD
	DeSalvo
	CAEED
	Darji
	BADED

Create a TestProcessor application that processes the test results file for any number of students.
