The following formulas can be used to convert English units of measurements to metric units:
 
	inches * 2.54 = centimeters
	feet * 30 = centimeters
	yards * 0.91 = meters
	miles * 1.6 = kilometers

Create a MetricConversion application that displays a menu of conversion choices and then prompts 
the user to choose a conversion. Conversion choices should include inches to centimeters, feet to cen
timeters, yards to meters, miles to kilometers, and vice versa. The application should include separate 
methods for doing each of the conversions.
