In the Hi-Lo game, the player begins with a score of 1000. The player is prompted for the 
number of points to risk and a second prompt asks the player to choose either High or 
Low. The player’s choice of either High or Low is compared to random number between 
1 and 13, inclusive. If the number is between 1 and 6 inclusive, then it is considered 
“low”. A number between 8 and 13 inclusive is “high”. The number 7 is neither high 
nor low, and the player loses the points at risk. If the player had guessed correctly, 
the points at risk are doubled and added to the total points. For a wrong choice, the 
player loses the points at risk. Create a HiLo application based on this specification. 

Modify the application to allow the player to continue until there are 0 points left. At 
the end of the game, display the number of guesses the user took before running out 
of points.
