Create a GeneratedNums application that generates the number to store in an array element by sum
ming its index and the individual digits of the index. For example, the element with index 17 should 
store 25 (17 + 1 + 7 = 25) and the element with index 2 should store 4 (2 + 0 + 2 = 4). GeneratedNums 
should use an array with 101 elements and then display the value at each element.
