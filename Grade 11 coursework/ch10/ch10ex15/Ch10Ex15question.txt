The game of Mankala is played on a board like that illustrated below:

Players sit on opposite sides with the large bin to a player’s right designated her home bin. On a turn, 
a player selects one of the six pits to remove the stones from and then “sows” the stones counterclock
wise around the board, placing one stone in each pit including the player’s home bin (but excluding 
the opponent’s home bin). If the last stone lands in the player’s home bin, the player gets another turn. 

If the last stone lands in an empty pit on the player’s side of the board, the player takes all stones in 
the corresponding pit on the opponent’s side and places them in the player’s home bin. When a player 
cannot play, the game is over and all stones remaining in the opponent’s pits go to the opponent’s home 
bin. The winner is the player with the most stones in the player’s home bin at the end of the game.

Create a Mankala application. The application should use simple characters to illustrate the board, 
and letters to identify the pits, similar to that shown below:

  3  3  3  3  3  3
 0                  0
  3  3  3  3  3  3
