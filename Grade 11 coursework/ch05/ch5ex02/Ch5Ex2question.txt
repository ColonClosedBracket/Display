A delivery service does not accept packages heavier than 27 kilograms or larger than 0.1 cubic meters 
(100,000 cubic centimeters). Create a PackageCheck application that prompts the user for the weight of 
a package and its dimensions (length, width, and height), and then displays an appropriate message 
if the package does not meet the requirements.
